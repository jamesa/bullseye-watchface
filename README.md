# Bullseye Watchface - [Get it here](https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/559def6f541f0cc2fa00009b)  
A really simple watchface featuring Target's mascot, Bullseye. I followed Pebble's
tutorial - this was really just for fun. :)  

On the free app directory as long as Target's Legal team doesn't remove it! :ghost:
